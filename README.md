# Selfhosted

A repository with my notes on selfhosting various applications

## Why

I love messing around with open source software and hosting and starting my own homelab seemed like the perfect way to remedy that. I find it fun to set up and configure services aswell as the problem solving along the way. 

## Current hardware

- Dell Poweredge R420 
    - 2x Xeon E5-2450L CPUs
    - 24gb memory
    - 1tb storage

## Applications
